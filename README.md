## project description

Create a Parcel Management system with role-based access, featuring three roles: User, Delivery Man, and Admin. Users can send and track parcels, while Delivery Men manage their delivery lists and handle deliveries. Admins oversee all users and delivery operations, ensuring efficient parcel management. The system facilitates seamless communication and control, enhancing the overall parcel handling experience for users, delivery personnel, and administrators alike.
